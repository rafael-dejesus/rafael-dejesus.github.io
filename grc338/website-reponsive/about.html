         <p>It was 1954 when I began to perfect the art of sandwich making. Visitors from all over the world would come to my house just to try the sandwiches which I had spent my whole life perfecting. It wasn't long before I opened my first restaurant, with many more to follow afterwards. Although we now have multiple locations around the world, Joe's Sandwich Shop still retains that classic, homemade feel that it has been known for.</p>
         <p>Our sandwiches are made fresh every day and just with the most quality ingredients. Our meats are prepared, marinated and broiled with no additional fillers or additives for maximum quality and flavor. We also boast the world's most highly rated grilled cheese in the world, in addition to several other fantastic choices.</p>
         <p>Come on down to Joe's Sandwich Shop today to find out why we're the greatest sandwich shop in history!</p>
