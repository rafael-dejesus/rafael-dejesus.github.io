		<input type="text" id="quantity2" name="quantity2" onInput="cheesecake()">
		<p class="test" id="test2"></p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li id="c1">1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
				<li id="c2">5 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
				<li id="c3">1.25 cups granulated sugar</li>
				<li id="c4">4 8-oz blocks of full-fat cream cheese</li>
				<li id="c5">1 cup sour cream</li>
				<li id="c6">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
				<li id="c7">2 tsp lemon juice</li>
				<li id="c8">3 large eggs</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat oven to 350º F.</li>
				<li>Make the crust: Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</li>
				<li>Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.</li>
				<li>Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven.</li>
				<li>Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>

		<h2>How many servings are you making?</h2>
		<p>(Default: 16 servings)</p>
		<input type="text" id="quantity3" name="quantity3" onInput="carrotcake()">
		<p class="test" id="test3"></p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li id="ca1">2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
				<li id="ca2">2 tsp baking powder</li>
				<li id="ca3">0.5 tsp fine sea salt</li>
				<li id="ca4">1.5 tsp ground cinammon</li>
				<li id="ca5">1.25 cups vegetable oil</li>
				<li id="ca6">1 cup granulated sugar</li>
				<li id="ca7">1 cup brown sugar</li>
				<li id="ca8">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
				<li id="ca9">4 large eggs</li>
				<li id="ca10">3 cups grated, peeled carrots</li>
				<li id="ca11">1 cup coarsely chopped pecans</li>
				<li>creamy cheesecake frosting</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Heat the oven to 350º F. Grease the cake pans and line the bottom with parchment paper then grease the top of the paper.</li>
				<li>In one medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and the cinnamon until well blended. In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, sugars, and vanilla. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, until combined.</li>
				<li>Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth. Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins.</li>
				<li>Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool cakes in pans for 15 minutes then turn out onto cooling racks, peel off parchment paper and cool completely.</li>
				<li>When the cake layers are completely cool, frost the top of one cake layer, and place the other cake layer on top. Decoratively swirl the top of the cake with remaining frosting, leaving the sides unfrosted. Scatter nuts on top.</li>
